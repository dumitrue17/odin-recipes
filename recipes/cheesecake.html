<h3>The Perfect Cheesecake Recipe</h3>
<p>The filling for this delicious, easy cheesecake recipe has just four simple ingredients, and the cake bakes in a mere 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Now THAT'S easy!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups (150g) graham cracker crumbs (about 10 whole graham crackers, crushed)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (28g) confectioners' sugar</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons (85g) butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>two 8-ounce packages (452g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
    <li><b>To make the crust:</b> Stir together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
    <li><b>To make the filling:</b> Mix together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth.</li>
    <li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching.</li>
    <li><b>To bake the cheesecake:</b> Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. 
        Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes).,<br> 
        A digital thermometer inserted into the filling 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</li>
    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and set it on a rack to cool. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
    <li>Serve cheesecake in wedges, with fresh fruit if desired.</li>
    <li><b>Storage information:</b> Store any leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for several days; freeze for longer storage.</li>
