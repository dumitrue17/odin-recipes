<h2>Homemade Chicken Doner Kebab recipe</h2>
<p>A homemade version of your favourite Chicken Doner Kebab!</p>
<p>Tastes remarkably similar to the diner kebab meat from your favourite takeout store. I've baked it, but imagine it rotisserie style over the BBQ or charcoal!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg / 2 lb chicken thighs</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup plain yoghurt</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp coriander powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp cumin powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix Marinade in a large bowl. Add chicken and mix to coat well.</li>
    <li>Cover and marinate in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours, 24 hours is ideal. If only 3 hours, add an extra 1/2 tsp salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 220C / 430F (standard) or 200C / 390F (fan / convection).</li>
    <li>Choose a pan of a size such that the skewers will stay propped up on the pan walls (see photos in post or video) and the chicken will be elevated off the base. Line with foil.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from fridge. Divide the chicken into 2 piles.</li>
    <li>Take one piece of chicken, fold in half then thread onto two skewers (see video). Repeat and push the chicken snugly up against each other. Repeat with other skewer.</li>
    <li>Prop the 2 skewers on the edges of the baking pan. Drizzle surface with oil.</li>
    <li>Bake for 35 minutes or until the surface is golden with some charred bits (char is good!).</li>
    <li>Spoon the pan juices over the chicken. Then turn, drizzle with oil and bake for 20 minutes (or 25 - 30 minutes if you had large thighs). If you need / want more colour, switch to grill/broil for a few minutes on high - I don't do this.</li>
    <li>Baste again with pan juices and stand for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Carving: Stand the skewers upright or on an angle, and slice meat fairly thinly. Use to make Doner Kebabs or Kebab Plates.</li>
